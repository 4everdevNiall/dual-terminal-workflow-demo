Dual Terminal Workflow Demo
In VSC I created 2 new folders with my Python file named agent and the area where my workflow log will be.
I then wrote a fake Python script imitating an agent creating stats and insights based on user-given inputs. 
In this code, I created my log file directory, created a list of replies and responses, as well as creating functions that take in data to log, open for appending, and push strings so that the data entered can be viewed on the other terminal with the correct data. 
This then allows you to open two split terminals and view both the development section and the audit section for a smoother development phase entirely.
